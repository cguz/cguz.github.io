# About Me

width="40%" hspace="20" align="right">

I am a passionate researcher and software engineer with a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence at the Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain. My expertise bridges the fields of multi-agent planning & execution, machine learning, and space.

My mother tongues are Rust, Java and Python, but I also speak C/C++ and PDDL. Most recently, I worked remotely as a Senior AI and Software Engineer.

With over 18 years of professional and academic experience in computer science, software and system engineering, I have a proven track record in (for more details on all that, check out [my research](/research/)):

- Applying AI to solve complex problems in the space sector, utilizing Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approaches. I have led projects like the SaaSy ML for OPS-SAT and currently manage the technical aspects of the ESTRACK Planning System.
- I actively develop and research AI solutions for spacecraft, including denoising images for OPS-SAT using machine learning techniques (GANs). I apply Responsible AI and Cybersecurity for AI, evident in my development of generative AI models (such as, Flan-T5, Llama2, GPT-J-6b) trained on GPUs using SLURM and following the MLOps methodology.
- I contribute to cutting-edge projects for ESA and EU, focusing on applying multi-agent planning and execution, and improving MBSE architectures and ontologies for spacecraft missions using ML.

I am a strong advocate for helping European organizations leverage the power of data through AI.
