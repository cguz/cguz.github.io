# About Me

I am a passionate researcher, software and system engineer with a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence at the Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain. My expertise bridges the fields of multi-agent planning & execution, machine learning, and space.

My mother tongues are Rust, Java and Python, but I also speak C/C++, PDDL, between other languages. Most recently, I worked remotely as a Senior AI and Software Engineer.

With over 18 years of professional experience I've tackled fascinating challenges in computer science, software, and system engineering.  Here are some highlights (check out my full [my portfolio] for more):

- I use AI to solve complex problems in the space sector, utilizing Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approaches. I even led projects like the SaaSy ML for OPS-SAT and currently manage the technical aspects of a cool ESA Planning System.
- I research and deploy cutting-edge AI solutions for spacecraft, like reducing image noise by a whopping 98% for OPS-SAT using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). 
- I am passionate about AI Responsible and Secure, and I put that into practice with projects like training Generative AI models (such as, Mistral, Flan-T5, Llama2, GPT-J-6b) on GPUs using SLURM and following the MLOps methodology.
- I contribute to cutting-edge projects for NASA, ESA and EU, focusing on applying multi-agent planning and execution, AI, and improving MBSE architectures and ontologies for space missions using ML.

I am a strong advocate for helping European organizations leverage the power of data through AI.
